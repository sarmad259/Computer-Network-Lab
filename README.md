## 📌 Lab Topics Covered

### 1. Static Routing

- **Objective**: Understand and implement static routing between routers.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Manually configuring routing tables.
  - Understanding route propagation limitations.
  - Verifying connectivity using `ping` and `traceroute`.

### 2. Dynamic Routing with RIP

- **Objective**: Implement dynamic routing using the Routing Information Protocol (RIP).
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Configuring RIP on multiple routers.
  - Understanding hop count as a routing metric.
  - Observing automatic route updates and convergence.

### 3. Dynamic Routing with EIGRP

- **Objective**: Configure Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) for efficient routing.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Setting up EIGRP with appropriate Autonomous System (AS) numbers.
  - Understanding EIGRP's use of metrics like bandwidth and delay.
  - Analyzing route tables and EIGRP topology tables.

### 4. DNS Server Configuration

- **Objective**: Set up and test a Domain Name System (DNS) server within a network.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Configuring DNS services on a server.
  - Mapping domain names to IP addresses.
  - Testing domain resolution using `nslookup`.
